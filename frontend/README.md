# Frontend Coding Challenge (React TypeScript)

This is the frontend portion of the fullstack coding challenge. It's a React TypeScript project that consumes the backend API to display product data.

## Project Structure

- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/services/` - API services for data fetching
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the coding-challenge-app directory:
   ```
   cd coding-challenge-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. The React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Challenge Tasks

1. Basic frontend tasks (if time permits):
   - Display product images from the API
   - Format the price with proper currency symbol
   - Add a simple filter to show products by category

2. Focus on making sure the frontend correctly consumes the backend API:
   - Ensure the API connection is working properly
   - Handle any data transformation needed on the frontend
   - Make sure error states are handled appropriately

## Tips

- The current implementation already includes basic error handling and loading states
- The main focus of this challenge is on the backend implementation
- The frontend is mainly to verify that your backend API works correctly
